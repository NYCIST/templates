Here are some instructions to help get your files organized before you leave. With regard to your G Suite data and files, there are three things that you can do (each option is outlined below).  

The first step for any of these option is to organize your files into folders.

#### Folder Organization Comes First 
The best starting point is creating a clean universal folder structure. An easy way to do this is to create a folder for each category of document and then make subfolders for each aspect of that category.  
An *uncategorized* folder can house all the documents that don't fit into any of the other folders yet. Scan through the *uncategorized* folder regularly and sort its contents into the appropriate labeled folders if possible.

#### Copy Your Data to Another Google Account 
You can transfer Mail and Documents that you own by following the instructions in the Google Knowledge Base here: [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6386856](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6386856). This option does not copy calendar, contacts, or documents shared with you.

#### Use Google Takeout to Take a Copy of Your Files  
Google Takeout makes a copy of all of your files and allows you to download them to a thumb drive or from another computer for you to keep after your departure. To use Google Takeout, visit [http://takeout.google.com](http://takeout.google.com). By default all categories are marked for download, but you might consider unchecking all but the following most common categories which include: bookmarks, calendar, chrome, contacts, drive, photos, and mail.  To learn more about this process and the files that will be created, click on the [Learn More Link](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en) under Step 1 of the Google Takeout Process.

**Now That You Have a Copy…**

Now that you have a copy of your files there are two options for the next steps…

**IF** you don't want a particular folder or file to be transferred elsewhere, just leave it! When your account is terminated on July 15, it will be permanently deleted.

**IF** you want a particular file or folder to be **MOVED TO A SHARED "Team Drive"** , follow the instructions below:

1. While holding down the Control Key, click on the folder that you want to move. When the menu pops up, click on **Move To**
2. Then click on the **Back Arrow** to Display the **Team Drive** Option
3. Double Click on **Team Drives** and then Double Click On the Team Drive that you want to move the file or folder to.
3. Navigate to the exact place within the **Team Drive** that you wish to move the file or folder to and then click on the blue **Move Here** button.  

❗_Warning: Once your item is moved to a team drive you will not be able to delete it and will need to put in a help desk ticket to have it removed._

#### Transferring Ownership
If you want to *Transfer Ownership* of a file or folder from yourself to another person at {{name of school}}, follow the instructions below:

1. While holding down the Control Key, click on the folder or file that you want to share. When the menu pops up, click on **Share**
2. Add the name of the person that you want to transfer ownership to and click **DONE.**
3. While holding down the Control Key, click on the same folder or file that you clicked on in step 1 above.
4. When the **share with others** box appears, click **advanced**.
5. Click on the **pencil drop-down** box and change the selection to **Is Owner**
6. The original file or folder ownership is changed and you now become a shared user with edit access.

\*Files/folder ownership can only be transferred to {{name of school}} employees with a {{school g suite domain}} email address.

#### Exporting Google Calendar Items 
To export your gCal items, follow the instructions listed in this Google Knowledge Base article: [https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111)

#### Saving/Tagging Emails  
If you would take specific email messages, chains, and conversations, you can use the tag tool along with google takeout to save to another account.

#### How to tag emails 
  1. Find the email you would like to save and click the labels icon above the subject line.
  2. Type in the label name
  3. The new label is now attached to the email.

#### How to find the email later on
