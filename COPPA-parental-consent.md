**Additional Consent**: 
 In order for **[Name of School]** (or **“the School”**) to provide your child with the most effective web-based tools and applications for learning, the School must abide by federal regulations regarding parental permission, as outlined below. **[Name of School]** utilizes several computer software applications and web-based services, operated not by the School, but by third parties. These include **[list examples such as Google G Suite]** and other educational programs that we trust and believe are essential. A complete list of the programs, along with the privacy policy and terms of service for each, can be found at:
**[URL with examples or list of the school's tech third-party-services]**  

In order for our students to use these programs and services, certain personal identifying information, generally the student’s name and email address, must be provided to the web site operator. Under the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule (“COPPA”), these websites must provide parental notification and obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. However, the law permits schools such as **[Name of School]** to consent to the collection of personal information on behalf of all of its students, thereby eliminating the need for individual parental consent to be given directly to the web site operator.

The undersigned Parent(s)/Guardian(s) agree(s) and understand(s) that throughout the year, the School will be using resources that may require the above-named student to have an account on an app, website, or a program that has been evaluated by the School’s employees and is in support of the School’s academic or community program.
